for bohb, hyperbamd can be completly be the same. But for succesive halving we sample totally different.
because instead of random sampling we use a model. That could be into succesive halving or in other method. 
I comment how i think we can change it. TPE needs to be one a file, like in bananas. we need a predictor which i have to look, and we need TPE  to discide which we are sample. Like in bananas
